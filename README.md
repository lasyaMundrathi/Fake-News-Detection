Fake news detection is the most pressing problem in the real world.

Our main aim is to perform sentiment analysis on the Fake news detection dataset consisting of 10,270 statements and we are simplifying labels as binary labels ‘Real’ or ‘Fake’. 

We use a Linear SVM classifier to predict labels and perform analysis on the model.
