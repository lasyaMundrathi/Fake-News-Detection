# Fake-News-Detection
Fake news detection is the most pressing problem in the real world. Our main aim is to
perform sentiment analysis on the Fake news detection dataset consisting of 10,270
statements and we are simplifying labels as binary labels ‘Real’ or ‘Fake’. We use a Linear
SVM classifier to predict labels and perform analysis on the model.
